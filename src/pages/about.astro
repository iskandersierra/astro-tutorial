    <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

    <p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>

    <p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>

    <h3>Some things about me:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="fact">My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
        <li class="fact">I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.</li>
        {identity.hobbies.length > 1 && (
            <li class="fact">Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}</li>
        )}
    </ul>

    <h3>My skills are:</h3>
    <ul>
        {skills.map((skill) => (
            <li class="skill">{skill}</li>
        ))}
    </ul>
